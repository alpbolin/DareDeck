# DareDeck

DareDeck is a Swift-based card game app designed to add excitement and challenges to your day. Shuffle the deck, draw a card, and complete a dare based on the card's number and suit. It's simple, fun, and a great way to engage in lighthearted challenges!

## Features

- **Card Representation**: Each card in the deck corresponds to a number:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Ace = 14
=======
  - Ace = 14
>>>>>>> 4983f4a9d31477fcf1cb70a0cdf796c141a4159a
  - Number cards = Their respective values (2 through 10)
  - Jack = 11
  - Queen = 12
  - King = 13

- **Suit Tasks**: Each suit (Clubs, Hearts, Spades, Diamonds) represents a unique task. For example:
  - **Clubs**: Push-ups
  - **Hearts**: Jumping jacks
  - **Spades**: Squats
  - **Diamonds**: Sit-ups

- **Randomized Draw**: Cards are shuffled and drawn randomly, ensuring every challenge is unpredictable.

- **Task Assignment**: The number on the card determines the count of the task. For instance, drawing the King of Clubs means doing 13 push-ups.
